Data files required to run the scripts and notebooks in `code` and generate the figures described in `methods`.

### Release 1

Data files used in Release 1 (Thompson et al., 2017) are found in several locations:

* Most processed files are in the current directory.
* All files except sequences are on the [EMP FTP site](ftp://ftp.microbio.me/emp/release1), with contents listed in `data/ftp_contents.txt`.
* All files except sequences are in the [Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/record/890000) for the [paper](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature24621).
* Sequences are in the [European Nucleotide Archive](http://ebi.ac.uk/ena/), downloaded using scripts in `code/download-sequences`.
