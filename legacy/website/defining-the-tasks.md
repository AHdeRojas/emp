There will be four key output from the EMP:

1.  ***Gene Atlas (GA)*** is a centralized repository and database for
    all information acquired during this study. This resource will
    follow the KBASE initiative and provide a searchable format to hold
    all information regarding annotation, environmental metadata and
    sequence. This will be a repository for all information, both known
    and unknown, the latter is also known as [Dark
    Matter](http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/beyond-darwins-wildest-dreams "Jon Eisen - Dark Matter").
2.  ***Earth Microbiome Assembled Genomes (EM-AG)*** will encompass all
    genomes assembled from EMP data, which will be annotated using an
    automated pipeline and provided in public repositories and a KBASE
    derived analytical platform. This will enable comparative genomic
    analysis against all known and EMP-derived genomes and metagenomes.
3.  ***Earth Microbiome Visualization Portal (EM-VIP)*** will engage
    with expert in interactive visualization software to synthesize our
    unique vision into a format accessible to all. In here we will view
    the earth in microbial space, describing environmental parameter
    space and genomic functional space, to allow the interrogation of
    EMP data and the discovery of new ecological theory.
4.  ***Earth Microbiome Metabolic Reconstruction (EMMR)*** will be based
    on metagenomic metabolome description and prediction software such
    as modelSEED and Relative Metabolic Flux (RMF) we will describe
    changes in metabolites and metabolite profiles through time and
    biogeographic space. This will be used to produce descriptions
    regarding metabolite production in specific biomes, providing
    another metric against which to refine biome descriptions.
