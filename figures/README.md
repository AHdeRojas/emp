#### Figure 1. Environment type and provenance of EMP samples included in this meta-analysis. 
**a,** Based on existing ontologies, the EMP ontology (EMPO) classifies microbial environments (level 3) -- with the number out of 23,828 samples in the QC-filtered subset in each environment provided -- as free-living or host-associated (level 1) and saline or non-saline (if free-living) or animal or plant (if host-associated) (level 2). EMPO terms are described in detail in Table S4.
**b,** Global scope of sample provenance: samples come from 7 continents, 43 countries, 21 biomes (ENVO), 92 environmental features (ENVO), and 17 environments (EMPO).
