## code/10-sequence-lookup

Code is used in the following section numbers of `figures/README.md`.

**3.11.2:**

* `summarize_otu_distributions.ipynb` (generate summary statistics for each sequence/OTU)
* `otu_entropy.ipynb` (determine which sequences have the most skewed environment distributions)
* `otu_trading_cards.ipynb` (generate LaTeX macros and charts for trading cards)
* `trading-card-latex` (render trading cards as PDFs)
* `trading-card-html` (render trading cards as web pages)

**3.11.3:**

* `otu_scatter_plots.ipynb` (plot the distribution of any Deblur sequence as a function of any metadata variable)
* `get_v4_region.py` (extract the V4 region of an input 16S sequence, specifying the desired length, e.g., to match 90-bp or 150-bp Deblur sequences)
* `verify_amplicon_type.py` (guess the amplicon type, e.g., 16S V4, using the first few basepairs of a multi-FASTA file)
