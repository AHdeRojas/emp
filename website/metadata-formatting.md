Formatting of Sample Metadata to Comply with GSC Recommendations
================================================================

The [Biological Observation Matrix (.biom) file
format](http://www.biom-format.org) is used for representing arbitrary
biological sample by observation data matrices, such as OTU tables or
metagenome tables, along with associated metadata. The .biom format
allows for interoperability of "comparative -omics" software tools by
providing a standard format that can be used across data types, and
provides a convenient means for storing data and metadata in a single
file.

submitting your sequencing results to the Earth Microbiome Project, you
must also include sample metadata. To facilitate correct formatting of
this information, researchers are encouraged to use [ISA
team's](http://isa-tools.org)
[OntoMaton](http://github.com/ISA-tools/OntoMaton). This package is most
easily accessed via Google Spreadsheets, where pre-made [GSC-compliant
templates](https://drive.google.com/templates?q=ontomaton&sort=hottest&view=public)
are available for downloading and editing in place.
