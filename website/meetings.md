NEON-EMP meeting (Boulder Colorado, USA, November 2011) {style="text-align: left"}
-------------------------------------------------------

The Earth Microbiome Project has an ambitious aim, to characterize the
diversity of microbial life on Earth. The project is founded on a
central tenant, that open data generation and data sharing improves
analytical capability and generates more results and understanding. The
EMP aims to create one of the largest comparable microbial ecology
datasets ever created. To do this, a consensus framework has been
generated within which individual researchers and communities can
function to enable cooperation and coordination of metagenomic sequence
data generation. NEON is one such community, which has already agreed to
promote the use of the EMP standard protocols in the generation of
sequencing data from its terrestrial monitoring stations. The aim of
this meeting is to understand how the EMP can help to integrate existing
sampling, processing and cyber infrastructure efforts within NEON to
enable a smooth transition to effective and efficient data generation.
The fundamental aim is to outline the most appropriate route forward to
creating comparable datasets from across the NEON network, which will
ultimately be comparable with the myriad of other EMP-associated
networks around the world.

1st International EMP Conference (Shenzhen, China, June 2011) {style="text-align: left"}

The 1^st^ International EMP Conference was an open meeting with over 100
attendees. There were 8 invited guest speakers, including Rick Stevens
(Argonne National Laboratory and University of Chicago) who gave the
keynote on the morning of the first day. In addition we had 22 offered
talks with presenters from 8 nations, including China, USA, Germany,
France, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, etc. The meeting was loosely
divided into two themes. The theme for Day 1 was microbial ecology,
which focused on why we need the EMP, tools and models for the EMP, some
preliminary data from the pilot study, and a number of exciting case
studies from EMP collaborators. The theme for Day 2 was standards and
bioinformatic techniques, which included novel data analysis tools,
standard data acquisition, and some considerations from previous or
existing massive sequencing projects, including Terragenome, The
Microbial Earth project, The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Virus
Sequencing Project, and Meta-HIT. [**Gilbert et al**. 2011. The Earth

EMP Workshop on Sample Acquisition (Chicago, USA, October 2010)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The second workshop was held at Argonne National Laboratory on October
6th 2010. The workshop was chaired by Rob Knight (University of
Colorado, Boulder), and we explored how we would collect samples and
what metadata should be collected. The report from this workshop was
also published in Standards in Genomic Science ([Gilbert et al.

Terabase Metagenomics Workshop and the Vision of an Earth Microbiome Project (Salt Lake City, USA, July, 2010) ****
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EMP was first concieved at an ICiS workshop held on 17 to 24 July
2010 in Snowbird, Utah. The workshop was chaired by Rick Stevens and
Folker Meyer (Argonne National Laboratory), and Jack A Gilbert (then of
Plymouth Marine Laboratory; now of Argonne National Laboratory), and was
aimed at determining how to use massive sequencing capacity to explore
microbial communities. This report from this first workshop has been
published in Standards in Genomic Science ([Gilbert et al.Â  2010.Meeting
